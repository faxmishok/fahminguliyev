Basically I am a computer science student and cybersecurity enthusiast who is heavily keen on software development and always open to learn new things. I have created this portfolio website to showcase some of my top projects that I developed during my Bachelor years.

<br />

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree at Politecnico di Milano majoring in Computer Science & Engineering.

<br />

I am skilled in number of programming languages, namely, C, C++, Java, (also some scripting
languages) Python, JavaScript, Go. I develop web applications as hobby in my spare time using latest
web technologies available.
